# abFMX
### Point Blank Audio programming Final Project

abFMX is a FM based synthesizer that combines 4 operators, lfos, envelopes and an effects processor to create complex sounds. 

My goal for this project is to recreate a custom patch I made on the yamaha reface dx based on an EP patch. 

Additionally I want to present an opportunity for FM synthesis sound design by allowing parameters to be
configured by the user including FM alogorithims (the arrangement of modulation operators and carrier operators), 
lfo depth and rate, feedback, distortion, delay and envelope shapes.


- [] make stereo
- [] distortion
- [] delay
- [] chorus
- [] loop envelopes
- [] lfo
- [] expose mod filter cutoff parameter to user
